## ⚡️ Current
Currently working on learning Next.js

## 💎 Experience
I like to say that I am a full-stack developer, but I have most experience with frontend development, primarily React & Javascript. However for the past few months I have been focusing a lot more on backend development, primarily using Node.js & C++.

Past from this, I am studying Software Development degree at Seneca College, focusing on low-level programming using C++ & specializing on advanced web designing using industry standard frameworks such as Angular &
