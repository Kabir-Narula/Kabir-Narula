# Hey, I'm Kabir! 👋  

I'm an 19-year-old Software Developer and games developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences and diving into the world of code. Here's a little about me: 

## ⚡️ Current

🚀 I'm currently focused on learning **Next.js**, an exciting technology that's expanding my skill set and knowledge.

## 💎 Experience

I like to consider myself a versatile developer. While I've spent most of my time working on frontend development, primarily with **React** and **JavaScript**, I've recently dived into the world of backend development, honing my skills with **Node.js** and **C++**. This journey has allowed me to explore both the client and server sides of applications.

In addition to my practical experience, I'm pursuing a Software Development degree at Seneca College. Here, I'm delving deep into low-level programming using **C++** and specializing in advanced web design using industry-standard frameworks such as **Angular** and **Express.js**.
