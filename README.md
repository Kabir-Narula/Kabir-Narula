## ðŸ’Ž Experience

I worked as a **Front End Developer** for a few months as a freelancer for a startup, focusing on building responsive interfaces and interactive user experiences. Currently, I am working as a **Student Office Assistant** and **Peer Mentor** at Seneca Polytechnic, where I support students academically and help manage administrative tasks.

I can speak multiple languages, including **English**, **Hindi**, **Korean**, and Iâ€™m currently learning **Japanese**.
